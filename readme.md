# Skyrim D&D

The aim of this project was to test my knoledge in js, and put everything i have learnt to the test. I have created a short game, that is inspired by my favourite game, Elder Scrolls Skyrim and one of my favourite genres dungeon and dragon / dungeon crawler. In this project I felt i have created this and more

## UX

The aims of my ux in the project are as follows:

Clean design that is simple to understand. I felt i have doen this by making the characters into tarot-like cards that make it simple to understand. Also the second page breaks down the character, its stats and a bio about it. In the fighting scene the Health of the character is visible, which helps the player to understand if they're winning or losing

The use of buttons throughout the game helps integrate the webpage into a more 'game' style, almost emulating controls on a joystick.

The background also helps set the scene for the game, immersing the player in the setting of the game and the dungeon-esque theme of the game.

## Technologies used

There are quite a few different languages used in the game. As standard HTML and CSS have been fully utilised to make a pleasurable experience and help the page look good.

1.Bootstrap has been used to set certain levels, keeping it simple and also responsive. Also the use of modals was key to this project as it helped scenes to flow better and keep the player in suspense. Also the 'how to' was also made with a modal

1.Javascript is the key player in the game, it helps it run throught the different stages, and initialise the players, scene, and game mechanic. The main mechanic is in GameInit, which holds all the functions and constructors used to make the game. I have separated the js files to keep things simle and organised, and if I wish to develop it in the future It will help keep things clear.

1.Jquery is also used to a lesser extent to help pull objects quicker, such as the modals. without it I would have been stuck with alert boxes, whick looked less apealing and a lot less user friendly.

## Deployment

Due to the time constraint I have had to omit a few scenes from the finished game, as it would take al least a week longer to create two more scenes, and a boss. Also it would look less polished and one of the key factoes is to make the game enjoyable for the player.

I have deployed it to Git Pages for viewing. when making the game there were a few errors when using git push and so may appear as several git commits took place at once, but that is not the case. 

## Credits

The biggest credit I need to give is for the youtuber *mmtuts*. It was his tutorial that I have learnt so much about specifics in coding games, I followed a few of his tutorials. He can be found on:https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis.

The second biggest credit has to be *bethesda*, for using its material from skyrim, such as the images, names and trademarked material. The background is also concept from the game and thus I say I do not own any of this material. 

I would also like to give credit for using the custom made font, by *DarkX ShadowX21*, which can be reached on: https://www.dafont.com/darkx-shadowx21.d5582. This was a big help as it set the scene for the game and was very similar to the actual skyrim game font.
